CucuDemo - simplest possible example!
=====================================

This demo covers three different scenarios to be tested.

# String based scenarios

We will test, if it's actually a Friday! Very useful function, ie. we need to have a proper test for it!

# Integer based scenarios

## Number addition

Does calculator know, how to add two numbers together?

## Number multiplication

And what about mutlipying numbers, can it do it properly, as expected?

# Challenge!

Add your own scenario and combine two tests together - ie. write a function, which adds AND multiplies some numbers!
